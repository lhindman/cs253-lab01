# Lab01 Guide
## Getting Started
Please complete the following to setup your local development environment before beginning the programming problems in this lab activity.  
- [Tools and Environtment Setup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hiJ_kHOGoNYcfNHuHdDpaydDvsMy9yEqYhL3j3X0kj4/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Visual Studio Code Intro Videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos)

Once your development environment is setup and running, please watch the [Lab01 Walkthough Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvnIObHoMl8d5D_Kjou-GB4SAs9atFCh8).  

**NOTE: Please remember to open the workspace before beginning on the lab activities**  

## Lab Warmup - Hello World
### Problem Description

For each of the following steps, end the program's output with a newline.

1. Write a program that outputs the following.  

```
Hello world!
```

2. Update to output the following.

How are you? 
```

3. Finally, update to output the following.  

```
Hello world!
How are you?
   (I'm fine).
``` 


### Implementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named LabWarmup and open the file named main.c
2. Enter the program code from the Problem Description
3. Test the program using to ensure it functions as expected.
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that LabWarmup is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.
6. Update the Coding Journal with an entry describing your experience using the steps outlined below.


## Lab Activity
### Problem Description
The objective for Lab01 is to simply become familiar with the development environment and the development workflow. Please complete both the Lab Warmup and the Coding Journal to receive full credit for this lab.

## Coding Journal (Optional)
Keep a journal of your activities as you work on this lab. Many of the best engineers that I have worked with professionally have kept some sort of engineering journal. I personally packed notebooks around with me for nearly 8 years before I began keeping my notes electronically.   

Your journal can track ideas, bugs, cool links, code snippets, shell commands, rants, or simply a reflection on what worked well or not-so-well with this lab activity. I will not be grading the content of your journal, but I will expect at least two timestamped journal entries of at least a 75 to 150 words each added to the provided Journal.md file.  The purpose of this component is to help develop the habit of taking notes and creating documentation while you code. The more detail you provide the better as that will help you if you ever need to refer back to this project in the future.

## Markdown Resources
Markdown is a notation that is used to format text documents.  It is widely used in Software Development shops around the world, which is why we're asking you to use it in your lab documentation.  

Github provides a guide for getting started:  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
