2. Enter the program code from the Problem Description
3. Run the program using the embedded links above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that LabWarmup is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.
6. Update the Coding Journal with an entry describing your experience using the steps outlined below.


## Lab Activity
### Problem Description
The objective for Lab01 is to simply become familiar with the development environment and the development workflow. Please complete both the Lab Warmup and the Coding Journal to receive full credit for this lab.

## Coding Journal
Keep a journal of your activities as you work on this lab. Many of the best engineers that I have worked with professionally have kept some sort of engineering journal. I personally packed notebooks around with me for nearly 8 years before I began keeping my notes electronically.   

Your journal can track ideas, bugs, cool links, code snippets, shell commands, rants, or simply a reflection on what worked well or not-so-well with this lab activity. I will not be grading the content of your journal, but I will expect at least two date-stamped journal entries of at least a paragraph each added to the provided Journal.md file.

### Implementation Details
1. Add an entry to the provided Journal.md located in the CodingJournal folder, formatted using markdown notation. You can find a reference at the bottom of this guide.
2. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating an entry has been added to the journal.
3. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.
4. Repeat for reach additional journal entry
## Markdown Resources
Markdown is a notation that is used to format text documents.  It is widely used in Software Development shops around the world, which is why we're asking you to use it in your lab documentation.  

Github provides a guide for getting started:  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
